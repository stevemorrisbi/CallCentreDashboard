#### Key Analysis - 

#### 1) Tech Support Calls represent the longest calls, the most common calls and with the longest wait time. 

#### 2) Billing calls consistently generate the most revenue.

#### 3) March is typically the busiest month of the year and February is the quietest. 

#### 4) 2021 generated the most revenue but was also the least efficient. 

#### 5) Average call wait time has risen by around 1/4 between 2020 to 2021 - more staff maybe needed for the increase in demand.

#### 6) Peak call demand falls the day or days after a public / staff holiday.
